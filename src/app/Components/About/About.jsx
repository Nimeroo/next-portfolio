      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Joel Giroux and I take delight in creating digital tools that
        people can utilize to simplify their daily lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ever since I was a young boy, I have always had an immense interest in
        technology so it was only natural that I would eventually find myself
        coding. I started learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript at only 12 when I
        wanted to create an animation for a class project. From there I
        continued pursuing different oppurtunities, from a coding internship to
        boilster my programming skills, to a coding bootcamp that taught me how
        web development is done on a professional level.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of now I am currently creating and updating projects as well and
        looking for new job oppurtunities that may come my way.
